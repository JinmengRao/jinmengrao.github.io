      abstract={Existing digital sensors capture images at fixed spatial and spectral resolutions (e.g., RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral images), and each combination requires bespoke machine learning models. Neural Implicit Functions partially overcome the spatial resolution challenge by representing an image in a resolution-independent way. However, they still operate at fixed, pre-defined spectral resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose Spatial-Spectral Implicit Function (SSIF), a neural implicit model that represents an image as a function of both continuous pixel coordinates in the spatial domain and continuous wavelengths in the spectral domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of SSIF on two challenging spatio-spectral super-resolution benchmarks. We observe that SSIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even when the baselines are allowed to train separate models at each spectral resolution. We show that SSIF generalizes well to both unseen spatial resolutions and spectral resolutions. Moreover, SSIF can generate high-resolution images that improve the performance of downstream tasks (e.g., land use classification) by 1.7\%-7\%.},

  abstract={In recent years we have seen substantial advances in foundation models for artificial intelligence, including language, vision, and multimodal models. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using foundation models in geospatial artificial intelligence, known as GeoAI Foundation Models, for geographic question answering, remote sensing image understanding, map generation, and location-based services, among others. However, the development and application of GeoAI foundation models can pose serious privacy and security risks, which have not been fully discussed or addressed to date. This paper introduces the potential privacy and security risks throughout the lifecycle of GeoAI foundation models and proposes a comprehensive blueprint for research directions and preventative and control strategies. Through this vision paper, we hope to draw the attention of researchers and policymakers in geospatial domains to these privacy and security risks inherent in GeoAI foundation models and advocate for the development of privacy-preserving and secure GeoAI foundation models.},

  abstract={The prevalence of ubiquitous location-aware devices and mobile Internet enables us to collect massive individual-level trajectory dataset from users. Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline methods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility research using generative AI techniques and explores data ethics issues in GIScience.},

  abstract={While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used for a variety of vision-language tasks, one observation is that they sometimes misinterpret visual inputs or fail to follow textual instructions even in straightforward cases, leading to irrelevant responses, mistakes, and ungrounded claims. This observation is analogous to a phenomenon in neuropsychology known as Agnosia, an inability to correctly process sensory modalities and recognize things (e.g., objects, colors, relations). In our study, we adapt this similar concept to define "agnosia in MLLMs", and our goal is to comprehensively evaluate and mitigate such agnosia in MLLMs. Inspired by the diagnosis and treatment process in neuropsychology, we propose a novel framework EMMA (Evaluation and Mitigation of Multimodal Agnosia). In EMMA, we develop an evaluation module that automatically creates fine-grained and diverse visual question answering examples to assess the extent of agnosia in MLLMs comprehensively. We also develop a mitigation module to reduce agnosia in MLLMs through multimodal instruction tuning on fine-grained conversations. To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we evaluate and analyze agnosia in seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using 9K test samples. The results reveal that most of them exhibit agnosia across various aspects and degrees. We further develop a fine-grained instruction set and tune MLLMs to mitigate agnosia, which led to notable improvement in accuracy.},

  abstract={The Internet of Food (IoF) is an emerging field in smart foodsheds, involving the creation of a knowledge graph (KG) about the environment, agriculture, food, diet, and health. However, the heterogeneity and size of the KG present challenges for downstream tasks, such as information retrieval and interactive exploration. To address those challenges, we propose an interactive knowledge and learning environment (IKLE) that integrates three programming and modeling languages to support multiple downstream tasks in the analysis pipeline. To make IKLE easier to use, we have developed algorithms to automate the generation of each language. In addition, we collaborated with domain experts to design and develop a dataflow visualization system, which embeds the automatic language generations into components and allows users to build their analysis pipeline by dragging and connecting components of interest. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of IKLE through three real-world case studies in smart foodsheds.},

  abstract={We present LOWA, a novel method for localizing objects with attributes effectively in the wild. It aims to address the insufficiency of current open-vocabulary object detectors, which are limited by the lack of instance-level attribute classification and rare class names. To train LOWA, we propose a hybrid vision-language training strategy to learn object detection and recognition with class names as well as attribute information. With LOWA, users can not only detect objects with class names, but also able to localize objects by attributes. LOWA is built on top of a two-tower vision-language architecture and consists of a standard vision transformer as the image encoder and a similar transformer as the text encoder. To learn the alignment between visual and text inputs at the instance level, we train LOWA with three training steps: object-level training, attribute-aware learning, and free-text joint training of objects and attributes. This hybrid training strategy first ensures correct object detection, then incorporates instance-level attribute information, and finally balances the object class and attribute sensitivity. We evaluate our model performance of attribute classification and attribute localization on the Open-Vocabulary Attribute Detection (OVAD) benchmark and the Visual Attributes in the Wild (VAW) dataset, and experiments indicate strong zero-shot performance. Ablation studies additionally demonstrate the effectiveness of each training step of our approach.},

  abstract={While the paths humans take play out in social as well as physical space, measures to describe and compare their trajectories are carried out in abstract, typically Euclidean, space. When these measures are applied to trajectories of actual individuals in an application area, alterations that are inconsequential in abstract space may suddenly become problematic once overlaid with geographical reality. In this work, we present a different view on trajectory similarity by introducing a measure that utilizes logical entailment. This is an inferential perspective that considers facts as triple statements deduced from the social and environmental context, in which the travel takes place, and their practical implications. We suggest a formalization of entailment-based trajectory similarity, measured as the overlapping proportion of facts, which are spatial relation statements in our case study. With the proposed measure, we evaluate LSTM-TrajGAN, a privacy-preserving trajectory-generation model. The entailment-based model evaluation reveals potential consequences of disregarding the rich structure of geographical space (e.g., miscalculated insurance risk due to regional shifts in our toy example). Our work highlights the advantage of applying logical entailment to trajectory-similarity reasoning for location-privacy protection and beyond.},

  abstract={Visual language tasks require AI models to comprehend and reason with both visual and textual content. Driven by the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), two prominent methods have emerged: (1) the hybrid integration between LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where visual inputs are firstly converted into language descriptions by VLMs, serving as inputs for LLMs to generate final answer(s); (2) visual feature alignment in language space, where visual inputs are encoded as embeddings and projected to LLMs' language space via further supervised fine-tuning. The first approach provides light training costs and interpretability but is hard to be optimized in an end-to-end fashion. The second approach presents decent performance, but feature alignment usually requires large amounts of training data and lacks interpretability. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a novel approach, Inner Monologue Multi-Modal Optimization (IMMO), to solve complex vision language problems by simulating inner monologue processes, a cognitive process in which an individual engages in silent verbal communication with themselves. We enable LLMs and VLMs to interact through natural language conversation and propose to use a two-stage training process to learn how to do the inner monologue (self-asking questions and answering questions). IMMO is evaluated on two popular tasks and the results suggest by emulating the cognitive phenomenon of internal dialogue, our approach can enhance reasoning and explanation abilities, contributing to the more effective fusion of vision and language models. More importantly, instead of using predefined human-crafted monologues, IMMO learns this process within the deep learning models, promising wider applicability to many different AI problems beyond vision language tasks.},

In this study, we looked at Chinese students applying for overseas GIS programs and examined factors influencing their decision-making. We distributed the survey in GISphere, one of the largest GIS international student communities, and 84 valid questionnaires were returned. We analyzed the spatial and demographic patterns of Chinese students applying for overseas GIS programs. We identify five main factors that affect their choices of GIS programs: (1) education quality and awareness, (2) physical, social, and political environments, (3) improved employment prospects, (4) personal recommendations, and (5) the application process. Our study offers implications for the development of GIS graduate programs.

Specifically, we develop a CFS-GeoKG ontology to describe geospatial semantics of a multi-commodity flow network comprehensively, and design resilience metrics that measure the node-level and network-level dependence of single-sourcing, distant, or non-adjacent suppliers/customers in food supply chains. We conduct a case study of the US state-level agricultural multi-commodity flow network with hierarchical commodity types. The results indicate that, by leveraging GeoKG, our method supports measuring both node-level and network-level resilience across space and over time and also helps discover concentration patterns of agricultural resources in the spatial network at different geographic scales.},

  abstract={Spatial clustering has been widely used for spatial data mining and knowledge discovery. An ideal multivariate spatial clustering should consider both spatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing, transportation, and urban planning, etc.},

Compared with traditional centralized learning frameworks, we keep users' data on their own devices and train the model locally so that their data remain private. The local model parameters are aggregated and updated through secure multiple-party computation to achieve collaborative learning among users while preserving privacy. Our framework also integrates information about transportation infrastructure, place safety, and flow-based spatial interaction to further improve recommendation accuracy. We further design two attack cases to examine the privacy protection effectiveness and robustness of the framework. The results show that our framework achieves a better balance on the privacy–utility trade-off compared with traditional centralized learning methods.

  abstract={Understanding house price appreciation benefits place-based decision makings and real estate market analyses. Although large amounts of interests have been paid in the house price modeling, limited work has focused on evaluating the price appreciation rate. In this study, we propose a data-fusion framework to examine how well house price appreciation potentials can be predicted by combining multiple data sources. We used data sets including house structural attributes, house photos, locational amenities, street view images, transportation accessibility, visitor patterns, and socioeconomic attributes of neighborhoods to enrich our understanding of the real estate appreciation and its predictive modeling. As a case study, we investigate more than 20,000 houses in the Greater Boston Area, and discuss the spatial dependency of house price appreciations, influential variables and their relationships. In detail, we extract deep features from street view images and house photos using a deep learning model, merging features from multi-source data and modeling house price appreciation using machine learning models and the geographically weighted regression at two spatial scales: fine-scale point level and aggregated neighborhood level. Results show that the house price appreciation rate can be modeled with high accuracy using the proposed framework (R2 = 0.74 for gradient boosting machine at neighborhood-scale). We discovered that houses with low house prices and small house areas may have a higher house appreciation potential. Our results provide insights into how multi-source big geo-data can be employed in machine learning frameworks to characterize real estate price trends and help understand human settlements for policy-making.},

  abstract={Understanding dynamic human mobility changes and spatial interaction patterns at different geographic scales is crucial for assessing the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as stay-at-home orders) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this data descriptor, we introduce a regularly-updated multiscale dynamic human mobility flow dataset across the United States, with data starting from March 1st, 2020. By analysing millions of anonymous mobile phone users’ visits to various places provided by SafeGraph, the daily and weekly dynamic origin-to-destination (O-D) population flows are computed, aggregated, and inferred at three geographic scales: census tract, county, and state. There is high correlation between our mobility flow dataset and openly available data sources, which shows the reliability of the produced data. Such a high spatiotemporal resolution human mobility flow dataset at different geographic scales over time may help monitor epidemic spreading dynamics, inform public health policy, and deepen our understanding of human behaviour changes under the unprecedented public health crisis. This up-to-date O-D flow open data can support many other social sensing and transportation applications.},

  abstract={Importance  A stay-at-home social distancing mandate is a key nonpharmacological measure to reduce the transmission rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but a high rate of adherence is needed. Objective  To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Exposure  State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures  The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state. Results  Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was –0.586 (95\% CI, –0.742 to –0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95\% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results. Conclusions and Relevance  These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.},

  abstract={The neighbourhood is a basic residential unit and is characterized by its physical setting, functional attributes and visual appearance. The visual appearance of a neighbourhood can directly affect the impression of humans regarding the local living environment. Assessing the characteristics of the visual appearance of a neighbourhood is significance for promoting people's physical activities, improving residents' sense of comfort and even ensuring the equality of facilities. However, studies assessing the spatial characteristics of visual appearance are still limited. Therefore, this article applies street view images to quantify the visual appearance of neighbourhoods at multiple scales in Shenzhen, China. Then, geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) is employed to explore the varying multivariate structures of visual appearance. The results confirm that GWPCA can be effective in assessing the visual appearance characteristics of neighbourhoods while considering spatial heterogeneity. The visual appearance characteristics of neighbourhoods are sensitive to both the spatial location and analysis scale. The extracted geographically weighted principal components (GWPCs) can represent the original screen elements by emphasizing certain comprehensive concepts, such as walkability, accessibility and vibrancy. The exploratory findings of this article allow for an improvement of studies on spatial quality at the human scale and could potentially guide neighbourhood planning and street design.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic, and social challenges that continue to escalate. Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What’s more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.},

  abstract={With the development of the economy and the acceleration of urbanization, traffic congestion has become a worldwide problem. Advances in mobile Internet and sensor technologies have increased real-time data sharing, providing a new opportunity for urban route planning. However, due to the difficulty of handling complex global information, making correct decisions in large-scale and complex traffic environments is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. In this paper, a multiple route planning model (multi-route dynamic programming (DP) model) is proposed to solve the urban route planning problem with traffic flow information. In particular, we adopt the DP algorithm in this model, design a reward function suitable for urban path planning problems, and generate multiple routes based on the Q values. In addition, we design different scenarios using real-world road networks to test our model. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our model has the potential to yield optimal results under large-scale scenarios with high efficiency. The advantages of integrating the distance contribution index (DCI) in the reward function are also elaborated. Moreover, our model can provide alternative routes to divert traffic from the optimal route, thus mitigating the congestion drift problem.},

Specifically, our dashboard takes campaign rallies and major events as narrative clues and integrates multi-perspective factors (e.g., the spatial spread of COVID-19, social distancing adherence, poll results) for visualization and statistical analysis. Compared with traditional methods and products, our integrated multi-perspective solution better balances the narrative property and the geovisualization property of a dashboard, making it suitable for illustrating social or political events that happened on a large geographic scale. The result shows that our narrative-based geovisualization dashboard may be used for demonstrating and associating multiple factors with partisanship and has the potential to help users explore the interaction between policies controlling COVID-19, social distancing, and partisanship across the country during the 2020 US presidential election.},

  abstract={Location uncertainty plays a key role in location-based services and applications. This research mainly focuses on the problem of location uncertainty when users are using the ride-hailing applications from the perspective of geographical contexts. The distance gap between the ride-hailing identified search location and the actual pick-up location was calculated and used as the measurement of location uncertainty. It may come from GPS noise or the gap between the current location of a passenger (eg, inside a building or a university campus) and the actual pick-up location along the streets for a ride. For the geographical contexts, this study considers factors including population density, road density, various kinds of Points Of Interests (POIs), and also the frequency of ride-hailing requests given a region. By using regression analysis techniques to find the relation between the geographical contexts and the distance gap, this study identifies potential factors (eg, enterprise buildings, dense roads, and highly populated areas) that affect the location uncertainty the most.},

Geoprivacy concerns arise on the issues of user identity de-anonymization and location exposure. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of geomasking techniques for protecting the geoprivacy of active Twitter users who frequently share geotagged tweets in their home and work locations. By analyzing over 38,000 geotagged tweets of 93 active Twitter users in three U.S. cities, the two-dimensional Gaussian masking technique with proper standard deviation settings is found to be more effective to protect user's location privacy while sacrificing geospatial analytical resolution than the random perturbation masking method and the aggregation on traffic analysis zones. Furthermore, a three-dimensional theoretical framework considering privacy, analytics, and uncertainty factors simultaneously is proposed to assess geomasking techniques. Our research offers insights into geoprivacy concerns of social media users' georeferenced data sharing for future development of location-based applications and services.},
