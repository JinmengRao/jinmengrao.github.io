I am a research scientist at [Mineral, Alphabet Inc](https://x.company/projects/mineral/). I was a research scientist and AI resident at [Google\[X\]](https://x.company). I got my PhD and MS from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), working with [Prof. Song Gao](https://geography.wisc.edu/staff/gao-song/) in the [Geospatial Data Science Lab](https://geography.wisc.edu/geods/).

I work on machine learning, deep learning, geospatial data science, and computational agriculture. Particularly, I am interested in incorporating data-driven AI approaches into geospatial domains to tackle challenges in human mobility, location privacy, public health, and food security.
