I am a research scientist at [Mineral, Alphabet Inc](https://x.company/projects/mineral/). I was a research scientist and AI resident at [Google \[X\]](https://x.company). I got my PhD and my second MS from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), working with [Prof. Song Gao](https://geography.wisc.edu/staff/gao-song/) in the [Geospatial Data Science Lab](https://geography.wisc.edu/geods/). Before that, I got my BS and MS from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Qingyun Du](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=yhy8DgsAAAAJ) and [Prof. Shiliang Su](http://sres.whu.edu.cn/info/1238/16237.htm).

I work on machine learning, deep learning, geospatial data science, and computational agriculture. In particular, I am interested in incorporating data-driven multimodal AI approaches into geospatial domains to tackle challenges in human mobility, location privacy, and food security.
